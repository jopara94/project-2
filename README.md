# Project 2

## Hack Overflow

- This project is a simple remake of Stack Overflow. Users can ask questions about software problems and leave their prospective answers, and correct other user's answers. 


## Technology Used

- Project was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose to give it full CRUD capability.
- Project will be deployed via Heroku

## Features

- Add new questions.
- Update questions.
- Delete questions.
- Displays the questions on the home page.

## Future Plans

- I plan on adding user authentication, a question category system so users can search for questions that may already have answers, and an answer confirmation system so users can see if an answer is absolutely correct.
